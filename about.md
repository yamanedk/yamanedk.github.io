title: Who I Am
---

Hello there! My name is Danielle Yamane and I am a compassionate, driven individual who strives to be the best version of myself as I continue on this journey of life. I'm going through a quarter life crisis and decided to create this as a medium for my excitement, curiousity and much more.

## Fun Facts

Some stuff about me include:

* I love to dance [Tahitian/Hula/Polynesian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoBI6vU1CM_eXktlgXu-r1w/videos?disable_polymer=1)
* Professionally, I have a career in IT/Security
* You can find me in the outdoors hiking, camping, or fishing with my dad.
* I am half Japanese and half Mexican; yes, I know I don't look Hispanic and filling applications out gets tricky when they ask for your ethnicity and don't give you an option to identify as multiracial. 
* Recently began an obession with collecting plants - yes, I am a Millenial.
* I listen to Indie Pop/Rock music on the daily, trying to find the latest hits like the hipster I am.
