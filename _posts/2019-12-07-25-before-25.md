title: 25 before 25
---

I'll be turning 25 in a little over 6 months and over the past few weeks I started to collect a list of experiences and action items I want to accomplish before I start freaking out about being a **quarter of a century** old. This list originally started on a Google Doc that I have been editting, but putting it here seems a bit more official. I will be contributing to this list, in attempt to document my life and keeping me on track.

### 25 things I will do before I turn 25 

1. Visit a new country - *11/27/2019-12/4/2019*
>Went to **TAHITI** for the first time to compete in the Ori Tahiti Nui competition. Going to the motherland has been a dream of mine since I started dancing. The entire time I was there it was a dream come true and was very sad to leave such a beautiful place; there is somthing about living a simplier life on that island that made me feel calm and collected. The steak frites, the warm water, the endless jokes and memories created with my hula sisters - I enjoyed every minute I was on that island and Mo'orea too. Tahiti, you gave me so much, and in return I hope I can take my experience and continue the legacy of the culture.
2. Visit a new state
3. Visit a new national park
4. Hike Mt. Baldy
5. Run a 5K
6. Self date
7. Real date
8. See a favorite band live
9. Compete in Ori Tahiti - *12/1/2019*
>Competed in Tahiti at the **Ori Tahiti Nui** competition in the 'Aito category. I made it to finals but did not place top 5; I am still very proud of myself. I got inspired that night watching the World Championship, promising myself to put in more hours and energy to better my technique and cultivate my creativity. I don't believe I'll ever master Ori Tahiti, but that's ok. I don't dance to be the best, I dance to be better than I am. 
10. Host an event (party/game night)
11. Outdoor activity
12. Water activity - *12/4/2019*
>Went **snorkeling** in Mo'orea with sting rays, black tip sharks, and a bunch of different species of fishes. I really enjoyed being in the water and observing the creatures in their natural habitat; I was in awe with their beauty - the bright color of their scales and the movement of their fins. Reminded me of the time I went snorkeling with my family in Hanauma Bay.
