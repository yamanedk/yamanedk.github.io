title: 25 before 25
---

I'll be turning 25 in a little over 6 months and over the past few weeks I started to collect a list of experiences and action items I want to accomplish before I start freaking out about being a **quarter of a century** old. This list originally started on a Google Doc that I have been editting, but putting it here seems a bit more official. I will be contributing to this list, in attempt to document my life and keeping me on track.

### 25 things I will do before I turn 25 

1. Visit a new country - *11/27/2019 - 12/4/2019*
>Went to **TAHITI** for the first time to compete in the Ori Tahiti Nui competition. Going to the motherland has been a dream of mine since I started dancing and falling in love with the culture. The entire time I was there I could not believe it and was very sad to leave such a beautiful place; there is somthing about living a simplier life on that island. The steak frites, the warm water, the endless jokes and memories created with my hula sisters - I enjoyed every minute I was on that island and Mo'orea too. Tahiti, you gave me so much, and in return I hope I can take my experience and continue the legacy of the culture.
