To myself 10 years ago,

You just finished your first semester of high school, congratulations! Throughout the next 10 years, you should be proud of all the small and big accomplishments you’ve achieved; take time to embrace the experiences, good and bad. Be grateful for the life you do have. The challenges that will be put in your path will help define your character. There will be times where you feel lost, and other times when you’ll know you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be. Crying will be frequent, let’s face it you are emotional and especially when you feel like you’ve failed. But there are so many positive memories you’ll create with family and friends, far more that you’ll cherish forever. 

Because you love lists so much, I’ve compiled a few.  And I know you love spoiling yourself to discover the conclusion, so here’s a summary of what will happen, my advice and dreams of the future.

Within the next 10 years:
1. You’ll lose friends but you’ll also make new ones
2. You’ll fail a class (AP US History) the most terrifying and humiliating experience, a huge fear of yours - but it’s ok, you’ll get through it.
3. You’ll graduate high school and college, both with honors 
4. You’ll be put down because of your race and gender - you’ll cry, then eventually get over it
5. You’ll have your first date, kiss, boyfriend but it won’t last that long; your Prince Charming is still out there and you have some great stories of other prospects trying to court you
6. You’ll travel to new places - in and out of the country
7. You’ll take advantage of the opportunities presented to you
8. You’ll find your sense of self, learn to love yourself
9. You’ll find your passions 
10. You’ll have started your career 

My advice to my younger self: 
1. Try anything and EVERYTHING, you have the time and energy
2. Be creative
3. Be curious 
4. Emphasize and showcase your gratitude more
5. Don’t be fearful 
6. Let things go, focus on what you can control
7. Go outside more 
8. Read, listen to podcasts
9. Stop with that wasted energy on boys, put that towards yourself 
10. Stop procrastinating and being lazy, it’ll prevent all those all nighters and stress you had to endure (maybe would have had less acne)

My dreams to my older self: 
1. I hope you’re married by then, maybe with a child/children(?) - no pressure but also a lot of pressure
2. I hope you own a home 
3. I hope you continue your education whether that be a masters, certification, training, etc.
4. I hope you continue to travel
5. I hope you have pushed yourself to live your life and be more empathetic 
6. I hope you got better at public speaking 
7. I hope you are developing yourself as a leader
8. I hope you stopped ruminating and reminiscing or at least to more of a healthy extent 
9. I hope you have given back to your family who have financially and emotionally supported you
10. I hope you’ve continued to surround yourself with great individuals who inspire you

And no, you don’t have all your shit together at 24; there’s still a lot to learn but you’ll get there, worry less. But I hope you are content just like you are right now.


Love, 
Me
